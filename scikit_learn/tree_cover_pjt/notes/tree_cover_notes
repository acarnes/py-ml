as you remove the variables plot the error
as you add variables plot the error
feature engineering
figure out how to improve the poorly predicted events
    find out which algorithm distinguishes between the mixed up classes the best
    say classes A and B are mixed up and call the rest class C, make a classifier to distinguish between (A or B) and C
    then use another method to distinguish between A and B

Optimize the different algorithms with a greedy method
