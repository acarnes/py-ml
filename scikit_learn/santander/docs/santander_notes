iROC Cross Validation on Training Set for Logistic Regression

Top 15 MI vars                                  : 0.79
All vars                                        : 0.68
Top 50 MI vars                                  : 0.81
Top 15 PCA vars (not normalized, with std_dev=0): 0.62
Top 50 MI PCA vars (normalized, no std_dev=0)   : 0.80

Now we look at balanced sets
--------------------------------
iROC Scores evaluated on whole set using 80% training, 20% test set

Top 50 MI PCA vars (normalized, no std_dev=0, mi whole)   : 0.798   [ made pca with balanced set, evaluated mi on whole set, chose top mi vars from that   ]
Top 50 MI PCA vars (normalized, no std_dev=0, mi bal)     : 0.792   [ made pca with balanced set, evaluated mi on balanced set, chose top mi vars from that]

Not much difference

Future Plans
---------------------------------
* Get average roc score on 20% test set
* Use the actual test set to test out the goodness of fit
* Try combination of PCA vars and regular vars
* Try average vote of balanced sets
* SHUFFLE SPLIT
* what is the volatility?
* Random Forests
